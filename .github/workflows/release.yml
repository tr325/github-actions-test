      # NOTE: Need to generate a personal token, not the generic ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} to trigger this, 
      #  as "automated" releases from the github actions account don't trigger `published` events on releases
      # We would replace this with eg. a step that notifies our Teams channel on merge to Master, (since that)
      #  would trigger a release. Check dockerhub for similarly "out of the box" images, or just write yourself
      #  a script that does the same.
